# Ghost Tower - 3D  Stack Building Game

## What is Ghost Tower?

Ghost Tower is an addictive 3D isometric stacking game where players build the tallest tower possible by precisely timing the placement of moving blocks. Each block moves in diagonal patterns across the screen, and players must click at the perfect moment to stack blocks accurately. The game features a stunning gradient color system that cycles through a rainbow spectrum, creating a mesmerizing visual experience as your tower grows higher and higher.

## What Makes This Game Innovative?

- **3D Isometric Perspective**: Unlike traditional 2D stacking games, Ghost Tower uses a sophisticated 3D isometric view with realistic depth, shadows, and perspective that creates an immersive building experience
- **Dynamic Rainbow Gradients**: Each new block features a different color from a 100-color gradient spectrum, cycling through vibrant reds, oranges, yellows, greens, blues, and purples to create a stunning rainbow tower effect
- **Perfect Timing Rewards**: Landing blocks with pixel-perfect accuracy (within 1 pixel tolerance) triggers special visual effects, color animations, and "PERFECT" text celebrations
- **Intelligent Block Cutting**: Misaligned blocks are automatically trimmed , with excess pieces falling away with realistic physics and rotation
- **Adaptive Camera System**: As your tower grows taller, the camera automatically zooms out and the container moves to keep your tower in view, increasing the visual challenge
- **Alternating Movement Patterns**: Blocks move in four different diagonal directions (left-up, right-down, left-down, right-up) that alternate with each placement, keeping gameplay fresh and challenging
- **Cross-Platform Controls**: Supports both mouse clicks and spacebar for accessibility across desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Features a professional theme toggle that adapts the entire game interface while preserving the colorful tower aesthetics
- **Reddit Integration**: Built on the Devvit platform for seamless Reddit integration, allowing scores to be saved and shared within the Reddit ecosystem

## How to Play

### Getting Started
1. **Launch the Game**: Click the "Play" button from the main menu to begin
2. **Initial Setup**: You'll see the first block (base) positioned at the center of the screen
3. **Moving Block**: A second block will immediately start moving diagonally across the screen

### Core Gameplay Mechanics
1. **Watch the Movement**: Each new block moves in one of four diagonal patterns:
   - Left-Up diagonal
   - Right-Down diagonal  
   - Left-Down diagonal
   - Right-Up diagonal

2. **Perfect Timing**: Click anywhere on the screen (or press spacebar) when the moving block is perfectly aligned over the previous block in your tower

3. **Block Placement**: Successfully placed blocks become part of your permanent tower structure and change to the next color in the gradient sequence

4. **Automatic Trimming**: If blocks aren't perfectly aligned, the overhanging portions are automatically cut off and fall away with physics effects

### Scoring System
- **+1 Point Per Block**: Each successfully placed block adds exactly 1 point to your score
- **Perfect Placement Bonus**: Landing blocks with pixel-perfect alignment (within 1 pixel) triggers:
  - Special color flash animations on the block
  - "PERFECT" text animation
  - Enhanced visual effects
  - Perfect sound effect
- **Best Score Tracking**: Your highest score is automatically saved to local storage and displayed
- **Game Over Condition**: The game ends when a moving block completely misses the tower below it

### Advanced Strategies
- **Perfect Timing Mastery**: Aim for the 1-pixel perfect range to maximize your tower's stability and trigger bonus effects
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learn the four movement patterns to anticipate where blocks will be at any given moment
- **Camera Adaptation**: As the camera zooms out with tower height, adjust your timing for the changing perspective
